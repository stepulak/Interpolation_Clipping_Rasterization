# Interpolation, clipping and rasterization

Interpolation, clipping and rasterization algorithms in C++.

Algorithms which can be found in this application:
- DDA, Bresenham line interpolation
- Bresenham circle/ellipse interpolation
- Cohen-Sutherland line clipping (interval bisection) in rectangular window
- Cyrus-Beck line clipping in convex polygon (which is randomly generated)
- Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipping (xmax part)
- Line seed fill of generic polygons
- Pineda's algorithm for triangle rasterization (min-max mechanism)
